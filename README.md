# Forecasting-Sales-Based-on-Advertising-Expenditure

## Project-Overview:
This project aims to build a linear regression model to predict sales based on advertising expenditures across three media channels: TV, Radio, and Newspaper. The goal is to understand the relationship between advertising budgets and sales performance and to create a Tableau dashboard to visualize the results.

## Dataset:

+ ## Source:
The dataset used in this project is the Advertising dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitkr60/advertisement-and-sales-data-for-analysis)).
+ ## Features:
+ TV: Advertising budget for TV (in thousands of dollars).
+ Radio: Advertising budget for Radio (in thousands of dollars).
+ Newspaper: Advertising budget for Newspaper (in thousands of dollars).
+ Sales: Sales of the product (in thousands of units).
+ Predicted_Sales: Predicted sales based on the linear regression model.

## Model Training and Evaluation:
+ The linear regression model was trained using the TV, Radio, and Newspaper features.
+ ## Evaluation Metrics:
+ Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted sales.
+ R-squared (R²): Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (sales) that is predictable from the independent variables (advertising budgets).

## Tableau Dashboard:
+ The Tableau dashboard provides a visual representation of the relationship between advertising expenditure and sales.

## Features of the Dashboard:
+ Scatter Plot: Shows the relationship between actual sales and predicted sales.

+ Bar Chart: Displays the impact of each advertising medium (TV, Radio, Newspaper) on sales.

+ Interactive Filters: Allows users to filter data by medium type or sales range to explore specific insights.
+ ## How to Access the Dashboard:
+ Download the Tableau_Dashboard.twbx file from this repository or with this [LINK](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/siddharth.jaiswal4545/viz/Forecasting_Sales_Based_on_Advertisement/ForecastingSalesBasedonAdvertisingExpenditure?publish=yes)
+ Open the file in Tableau Desktop to interact with the dashboard.

  
## Results:
+ Key Findings:
+ TV and Radio advertising have a stronger positive correlation with sales compared to Newspaper advertising.
+ The model achieved an **R² score of 0.85185**, indicating that approximately **85.185% of the variance in sales** is explained by the advertising expenditures.
